\chapter{Background and State of the Art}

To contextualize the contributions of this thesis, it is necessary to establish the theoretical foundations upon which it is built. This chapter explores the evolution of distributed systems toward collective intelligence and examines the formalisms of self-organizing frameworks. By evaluating the limitations of current simulators, this chapter identifies the technical `reality gap' that this research aims to bridge, providing the necessary background to appreciate the integration of high-fidelity game engines into the decentralized coordination workflow.
